# ASL4RPA
Organisations need to adopt the latest technological improvements to remain competitive, especially in their information technologies (IT), supporting their business processes. Furthermore, organisations must optimise their IT resources and better support their bureaucratic procedures to achieve this goal. Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is a technology that supports automation with software robots (or just bots) to replace human tasks that tend to be repetitive, tedious, or prone to errors.
RPA is a technology that mainly uses software robots to automate the work done by humans. These software robots can execute workflow with multiple steps and interact with several applications. Examples of tasks performed by these Software bots are: automated email, query processing, data transfer between applications through screen scraping or updating a spreadsheet.
The main benefits of RPA applications are cost and time reduction and increased productivity. These software robots focus on specific tasks and can execute tasks in a few minutes, which manually could last several hours or days. 

The main goal of the project ASL4RPA is to provide a systematic approach to describe RPA applications in a platform-independent way, close to natural language and understandable by non-technical people. 
The purpose of this tool is not to replace existing RPA tools but to allow specifying robot behaviours in a platform-agnostic and platform-independent way, describing the robots that a given organization has.
Some of the organization's stakeholders are not interested in looking at the script with code but are interested in being able to communicate in the same language as the developers, closer to the business area, both in an early stage and in an advanced stage with the robots in operation.
